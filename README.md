# skinML
Python project using SKLearn's linear regression machine learning algorithm to attempt to predict skin prices based on color, release date, and initial price.

From the trends I had seen when investing in Rust skins, I figured that there would be enough of a correlation between the above variables and a skin's price to use a model for prediction. Through extensive testing, however, it seems as though there isn't enough of a relationship to predict skin prices with the accuracy I was hoping for. After testing with various ways of determining an image's color I decided to use the best model I had with an accuracy value of ~.5 for my Discord bot because I didn't want all of the work that went into the bot to go to waste.
